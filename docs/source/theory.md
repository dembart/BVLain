# Theory behid

The program is based on the theory developed by S. Adams and co-authors. For example, see  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pssa.201001116"> this</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052520618015718">this</a>.

Briefly, we construct a scalar field f(x,y,z) of interaction between between tracer ion (e.g. Li$^{+}$) and its framework in each given point (x,y,z) within a unit cell. The scalar filed is a sum of Coulombic repulsion (if tracer ion is cation) and Morse-type interaction potential. Such field constructed on a equidistance meshgrid can be treated as a distribution of a tracer ion-framework interaction energies.
